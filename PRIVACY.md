Privacy Policy for Smart Download Organizer
Last Updated: July 18, 2025

Hi there! I'm the developer of Smart Download Organizer, and thank you for using it. Your privacy is extremely important to me. This policy isn't full of complicated legal jargon; it's a straightforward explanation of how the extension handles your data.
The most important thing to know is that I don't have any servers, and I never see or save your personal information. Everything the extension does happens locally on your computer. The Non-LLM mode never sends any type of data to third party services, as it happens to be an algorithm set up locally.

You Are in Complete Control
The extension works by connecting to an AI service to get organizational suggestions, but you're the one in the driver's seat.
You Provide the Keys: You have to enter your own API Key and API Endpoint URL from an AI service you choose.
You Choose the Service: You can connect to any compatible AI service. I don't have any special relationship with any of them.
This means you are always in full control of the tools the extension uses.

What Information Does the Extension Actually Handle?
To do its job, the extension needs to work with some information on your computer. Here’s a simple breakdown:
Your AI Service Credentials: This is the API Key, Endpoint URL, and Model Name that you enter in the settings. I store these securely using the browser's built-in storage (chrome.storage.sync) so your settings are saved just for you, across your own devices. I never see these keys—they are only used by your browser to talk directly to your chosen AI service.
Download and Browsing Context: When you download a file, the extension needs to understand its context to ask the AI for a good suggestion. To do this, it looks at:
The file's name and the website it came from.
The title and URL of your current browser tab.
URLs and titles from your recent browsing history.
This information is only gathered in the moment to create the request for the AI. It is not stored and is immediately forgotten afterward.
Temporary Keyword Cache: To work faster and not analyze the same page over and over, the extension temporarily saves the results of its keyword analysis on your computer. This is just a temporary cache to improve performance and is cleared regularly.

Where Does My Data Go?
I want to be crystal clear about this: The extension only sends data to the API Endpoint URL that you provide.
Because you choose the AI service, I am not responsible for what that service does with your data. I strongly recommend you check out the privacy policy for whatever AI service you decide to use.

How Do I Stay in Control?
You are always in charge.
When you enter your API key, you're giving the extension permission to send the contextual data (as described above) to the endpoint you specified. You can change your mind at any time. Just delete your API key and settings from the extension's options page. This will immediately stop the extension from sending any data.

Security
I've built the extension to be as secure as possible within your browser. It uses standard browser storage APIs and always communicates with your chosen AI service over a secure HTTPS connection.

Changes to This Policy
If I ever need to update this policy, I'll post the new version here and change the "Last Updated" date at the top.

Contact Me
I made this extension by myself, so if you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out.
